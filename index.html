<title> About Leslie Mittendorf </title>

<body>



<p>I&rsquo;m a senior interaction designer living in Seattle, WA. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I want to be able to build my own responsive websites and prototypes. </P> 

<h2>My Mission</h2>

As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a Front End Designer with a focus on UXUI with Frog Design or Tableau because I like to work in a fast-paced environment resolving complex design challenges. I particularly like data visualization, and have a soft spot for health and human services non-profit work.
