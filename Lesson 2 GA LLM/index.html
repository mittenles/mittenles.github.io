<h2> <b><a href=www.Southwest.com>Southwest</b></a> to <b><a href=www.hipmunk.com>Hipmunk</b></a> Hipmunk &ndash; </b> Landing on two different travel sites: a comparison of Space, Size, Balance</h2> 
<br>
</h2> How do these two websites use Space as a design element?</h2>
 <p>Hipmunk and Southwest both use a significant amount of negative space, though the treatment of the space does differ. <br>The negative space in Southwest's homepage includes an image, one that is seasonally appropriate and ostensibly will change to reflect the primary motivating reasons people visit the site.</P>  
 	<br>
 	<p>On Hipmunk, negative space is used to convey a sense of travel- air travel, specifically. And the focal points, or calls to action, appear to float on the background.

<h2>How do these sites use <b>size</b> as a design element?</h2>
<p>In the case of Southwest, the focal point is created by the <b>size</b> of the call to action (book a ticket home for $73 just in time for the holidays) is so large as to draw the eye directly to the element, even if the user was looking for the more universal call to action- the booking elements.  
<br>
<p>In the case of Hipmunk, the size of the primary two calls to action make up a significant chunk of the prime focal space, with a combination of negative space within the controls and the large font creating a great focal point. </p>

<h2>How do these sites use <b>balance</b> as a design element?</h2>
<br>
<p>The balance of both sites falls nicely with horizontal centering within a vertical grid. While the content overflows the two, it is nicely balanced. </p>

<br>
<p>The vertical balance differs slightly between the two sites. If Hipmunk is divided by a four row grid, the majority of the top and bottom sections have light content, but the main focal point is anchored at the bottom of the first section, which draws the eye to a hierarchy from top to bottom.<p/>
	<br>
	<p>Southwest tends more towards a balance of thirds, with a contextual focus weighted towards the top half of the site, and the primary anchored to the top of the bottom half.

<br>
<p> The two sites share many design similarities, particularly in their sparse approach as a way of highlighting the primary actions. Both also do a nice job in their flow, once the user interacts with the controls. SW has a left to right flow and hierarchy. Hipmunk uses a left, down, right, or the <b>N</b>, pattern. Hipmunk also uses progressive disclosure nicely to keep the interface clean and focused, but deliver a functionally appropriate experience.
